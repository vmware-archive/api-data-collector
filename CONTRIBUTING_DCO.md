* Documentation
* Bug fixes

## Getting started
Because ADC is a Chrome DevTools extension, you need to know how to use or test it:
- Chrome DevTools: go to chrome://extensions/, then choose either Upload unpacked or Update for local testing this ADC extension
- Open Chrome DevTools, then find and click on the ADC tab to use it


## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
Make commits of logical units
Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Example:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware-labs/api-data-collector.git
git checkout -b my-new-feature main
git commit -a
git push origin my-new-feature
